Topic: Geomorphometry III: Spatial and Temporal Terrain analysis

Task: Compare topographic parameters derived from different types of elevation models

</code></pre>

<p>
create the assignment working directory (folder) .\Assign9<br>

start ArcMap<br>

<pre><code>
Start->Programs->ArcGIS->ArcMap

</code></pre>

<p>
compute basic topographic parameters from 10m NED<br>

<pre><code>
In ArcMap
Select File->Add Data->Add Data...
Select ncrast.mdb/elev
Check out a Spatial Analyst Extension license
Open the ArcToolbox
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->Slope'
Set 'Input raster' to 'elev'
Set 'Output raster' to '.\Assign9\Slope_elev'
Set 'Output measurement' to 'DEGREE'
Click 'OK'

</code></pre>

<p>
do the same for Aspect and Curvature<br>
try to create a meaningful diverging color table for curvatures<br>
with two color shades and light color in the middle<br>
<!--note that histogram equalized may crash ArcGIS (can you say why and how to avoid it?)-->
Compute topographic parameters from SRTM DEM and compare with NED<br>

<pre><code>
In ArcMap
Select File->Add Data->Add Data...
Select ncrast.mdb/elev_srt
Open the ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->Slope'
Set 'Input raster' to 'elev_srt'
Set 'Output raster' to '.\Assign9\Slope_el_srt'
Set 'Output measurement' to 'DEGREE'
Click 'OK'

RMC 'Slope_el_srt->Properties->Symbology->Classify 
</code></pre>

<p>
compare mean and stddev in Classification statistics with 10m NED derived<br>
slope explain the differences between slope from 10m NED and 30m SRTM<br>

compare slope and aspect, from TIN and from 1m raster DEM<br>
use a previously created TIN or create a new one<br>
see Assignment 7, the first of two covering the topic of Spatial interpolation<br>

<pre><code>
In ArcMap
Select File->Add Data->Add Data...
Select ncshape.mdb/elev_lid792_randpts
</code></pre>

<p>
create TIN 'tin' in 3D Analyst from these points if you don't have it already<br>

<pre><code>
Open ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select 3D Analyst Tools->TIN Management->Create TIN
Set 'Output TIN' to .\Assign9\lid792_tin
Set 'Input feature class' to elev_lid792_randpts
In the Input feature class list, find the "height_field" (2nd field from left). 
Click on the entry for the elev_lid792_randpts (Shape_Z is displayed by default). 
By clicking on the field it should convert to a drop-down list. 
Click the down arrow to display your list of options and select "Value_".  
Click 'OK'
</code></pre>

<p>
<!-- # compute slope
Open the ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select '3D Analyst Tools-> terrain and TIN Surface -> Surface Slope'
Set 'Input Surface' to 'lid792_tin'
Set 'Output Feature Class' as '.\Assign9\lid792_tin_SurfaceSlope' 
Set 'Slope Units' to 'DEGREE'
Click 'OK'

# do the same for Surface Aspect to create: '.\Assign9\lid792_tin_SurfaceAspect' -->
compute slope<br>
the output from this process is a polygon feature class whose attribute (found<br>
in the slope class field) consists of the slopes binned into 7 classes. The<br>
default (ESRI) breaks (bins) are at 0.57, 1.43, 2.66, 5.71, 12.13, 24.89,<br>
45.0, 90.0.<br>

<pre><code>
Open the ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select '3D Analyst Tools-> Triangulated Surface -> Surface Slope'
Set 'Input Surface' to 'lid792_tin'
Set 'Output Feature Class' as '.\Assign9\lid792_tin_SurfaceSlope' 
Set 'Slope Units' to 'DEGREE'
Click 'OK'

</code></pre>

<p>
do the same for Surface Aspect to create: '.\Assign9\lid792_tin_SurfaceAspect'<br>
As with slope, the aspect that comes from this process is in the form of a<br>
polygon feature class whose aspect attribute is binned into eight 45 degree wide<br>
directions (code = 1 - 8 ). These are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW,<br>
respectively. Assign suitable colors to the slope and aspect polygons.<br>

derive slope from 6m raster DEM<br>

<pre><code>
Select File->Add Data->Add Data...
Select ncrast.mdb/elid_792
Open the ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select '3D Analyst Tools -> Raster Surface -> Slope'
Set 'Input raster' to 'elid_792'
Set 'Output raster' to '.\Assign9\slope_elid71'
Click 'OK'

</code></pre>

<p>
to get more continuous color table<br>

<pre><code>
RMC 'Slope_elid71' 
Select 'Properties -> Symbology"
Change Classes to 32
Click 'OK'

</code></pre>

<p>
compute the curvature, and change the color table to one that has lighter<br>
break in the middle. Do you see a problem, suspicious pattern?<br>
Can you explain it?<br>
hint - the DEM was interpolated using v.surf.rst (GRASS) which uses<br>
quadtree segmentation<br>

------optional---------------------------------------<br>
interpolate 1m resolution DEM from elev_lid792_randpts<br>
using IDW and spline (Spatial Analyst Tools->Interpolate->)<br>
compute and display curvature (Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->)<br>
from the IDW and spline surface. Can you infer from the result what type of<br>
point selection technique was used in these modules?<br>

compute cut and fill volumes (Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->) from the<br>
