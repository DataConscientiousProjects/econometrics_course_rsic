<h2>Projects Fall 2012 </h2>
Presentations: regular class - 12 min talk + 2-3 min discussion, DE - 10 minute slides with audio. 
One of the presentation goals is to get feedback from the class
and ideas on how to enhance the project. Early presenters discuss
the current status of the project and what will be done.
