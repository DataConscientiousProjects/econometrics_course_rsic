<h4>Assignment part B</h4>
<!--
<ul>
  <li> use buffers around lakes to find developed areas
  <li> use buffers along the major roads to find neighborhoods and schools
       that may be affected by noise pollution</li>
  <li>assume there was an accident at a give site on Hwy 1. Compute cost surface for getting to the site
from any point in the study region using the street map converted to raster. Find which
firestation has the lowest cost to get there and find the shortest path. Find the 2nd and 3rd
closest station and path. Discuss the issue of interchanges.

    <h4>Homework:</h4>
        Prepare a paper on applications of global and zonal statistics,
        neighborhood operations and map algebra for analysis of continuous and discrete geospatial data.
        In this paper also explain and demonstrate the use of buffers and cost surfaces
        for solving proximity problems. Comment on specific results for the study area and given tasks.
