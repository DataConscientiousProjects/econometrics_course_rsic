   <h3>Summary statistics</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Continuous raster data:</b> 
  <ul>
   <li>stored numbers are values quantifying the phenomenon
   <li>univariate statistics: min, max, mean, standard deviation, 
   <li>histogram (requires discretization into bins) 
  </ul>
  <li><b>Discrete raster data:</b>
  <ul>
   <li> stored numbers can be values (quantitative data) or category numbers (qualitative data)
   <li>univariate statistics can be applied only to quantitative attributes 
   <li>mode (most frequent cat), diversity (number of different cats)  apply to category data 
</ul>
<p> Can be applied as <b>global, zonal, or focal </b> operations
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Global statistics: continuous data</h3>
<p> Continuous raster data: elevation from different sources
<p> mean, stdv, histogram, equations
<p>Image composit: slide 7
<p> helps us identify data anomalies and potential artifacts 
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Global statistics: continuous data</h3>
<p> Continuous raster data: elevation from different sources
<p> correlation matrix, regression, eq
<p>Image composit: slide 8
<p> helps us decide which data set to use for our application
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Global statistics: discrete data</h3>
<p> Soil properties: erodibility mean OK, soil type ID use mode
<p>Image composit: slide 9
<p>this slide can be skipped
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Zonal statistics: continuous data</h3>
<p>Example from hydrology: 
<p>mean slope for a watershed to estimate how fast water is moving through it
<ul>
  <li>Raster 1: discrete raster (watershed)
  <li>Raster 2: continuous field (slope) 
  <li>Resulting raster 3:  mean slope each watershed (discrete raster)
  <li>Resulting raster 4:  standard deviation of mean slope for each watershed (discrete raster)
  <li>What does it mean for the movement of water if stdv is high relative to mean?
</ul>
Image composit: see slide 12
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Zonal statistics: category data</h3>
<p>Example from land use analysis:
<p>Find prevailing land cover in zipcodes/census blocks? to support regional planning
<ul>
  <li>Raster 1: discrete raster (zipcodes)
  <li>Raster 2: discrete raster (land use)
  <li>Resulting raster 3:  most frequent land use 
  <li>Resulting raster 4:  number of different categories 
  <li>guess the classes in the results or compare 96 and 2011
</ul>
<p>Image composit: see slide 14
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Neighborhood operations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focal operations: value at a grid cell is function of its neighborhood values.
<li>Grid cell neighborhood – moving window, square or circular 
<li>Same rules apply for continuous and discrete data as for global and zonal stats
<li>Basic univariate statistics, special filters (image processing app)
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Neighborhood operations: smoothing</h3>
<p>Smoothing noise in DEM: focal mean with 5x5 window
<p>Show equation
<p>Image composit: see slide 18
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Neighborhood operations: focal diversity</h3>
<p>Diversity in landuse? skip this?
<p>Image composit: see slide 20
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Raster map algebra</h3>
<p>
Computes a new raster map using expression built by applying logical and/or arithmetic operators, 
mathematical functions to existing raster maps representing variables:
<p>
newmap = expression (map1, map2, ...map3)
<p>
Local: Expression is applied on per-cell basis
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Raster map algebra</h3>
<p>
Each software has its own syntax and set of operators and functions, examples:
<ul>
<li>Logical operators and functions: 
<ul>
  <li>less than, equal, 
  <li>and, or, not, ...; 
  <li>if(x), if(x,a,b)
</ul>
<li>Arithm. Operators
<ul>
<li> +, -, *, / 
</ul>
<li>Math. Functions: 
<ul>
<li>exp(x,y),sin(x),log(x)
<li>min(x1,x2,..), max(), median()
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Raster map algebra: logical expressions</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> apply to both continuous and discrete (category) data and their combination 
<li>use for complex reclassification, masking and overlays
<li>Example: find all forested areas with elevation > 120m
use more meaningful example
</ul>
<p class=small>GRASS GIS expression
highforest = "if(landclass96==5 && elevation > 120., elevation, null())”
<p class=small>
ArcGIS expression
ADD
<p>Image composit: see slide 30
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Raster map algebra: math functions</h3>
<p>
better example?
<p>
Example: for all forested areas, compute sediment transport capacity using the following equation 
<p>equations
<p class=small>GRASS GIS expression
sediment = "if(landclass96==5, exp(contrib_area,1.5) * sin(slope), null())”
<p class=small>
ArcGIS expression
ADD
<p>Image composit: create new
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Raster map algebra: null data</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Raster maps can include NULL data (no-data), each software has its own rules how to handle them in map algebra operations
<li>General rule: If a cell is null in at least one map (variable) then it is null in the resulting map
<li>"If “ statements can test for null and/or assign a cell null value based on the if condition
<li>Special operators can be implemented to extend the rules applied to nulls
</ul>
