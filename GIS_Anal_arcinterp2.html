Topic: Spatial Interpolation and approximation
<br>Task: Demonstrate impact of interpolation methods on resulting surface using hillshade, 
histogram and univariate statistics
<P>
Interpolate elevation surfaces from spot point heights using the Spline tool 
in the Spatial Analyst toolbox. Use three different weights (0.1, 1, 1000) to control the tension, and thus, the resulting surface character. For the first interpolation, you'll leave the Weight field blank, accepting the default 0.1 value. In subsequent interpolations, you'll enter the explicit weights (i.e., 1, and 1000).
<P>
Use the Geostatistical Analyst tool's Radial Basis Functions to generate at least two different elevation surfaces. In the first surface you'll use the RBF multi-quadric method. In the second, you'll choose Regularized Spline.

interpolate DEM using Spline<br>

<pre><code>
ArcMap File->Add Data->Add Data...
Select ncshape.mdb/elev_lid792_randpts
Check out a Spatial Analyst Extension license
Open the ArcToolbox
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Interpolation->Spline'
Set 'Input Point Features' to 'elev_lid792_randpts'
Set 'Z value field' to 'value_'
Set 'Output Raster' to '.\assign8\elev_tps'
Set 'Output cell size' to '2'
Set to Spline Type to 'Tension'
Leave the other inputs as defaults     
Click 'OK'

</code></pre>

<p>
check the interpolated elevation surface using hillshade<br>

<p>
set the default output raster cell size environment variable to 2<br>

<pre><code>
Geoprocessing->Environments...->Raster Analysis->Cell Size
Set 'As Specified Below' and enter 2 in the field that follows.
Click 'OK'
Open the ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select '3D Analyst Tools -> Raster Surface -> Hillshade'
Set 'Input Surface' to 'elev_tps'
Set 'Output Raster' to '.\assign8\Hillsh_tps'
Leave the other inputs as defaults
Click 'OK'

</code></pre>

<p>
Repeat the splined interpolations, above, using weights of 1 and then 1000,<br>
and generate the associated hill shade surfaces.<br>
Compare the three hill shade surfaces, and discuss your findings in your report.<br>
