<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Topics</h3>
You can use a topic from your thesis or expand a project that you have
worked on in other classes, but make sure that your <em>project
includes a component that requires processing and/or analysis of continuous field(s)</em>,
such as elevation, precipitation, chemical concentrations, etc.
<p>
You can collaborate on the projects, for example by studying different regions
and then compare the results. Or you can select
a common area (e.g. SW Wake county) and do several analyses related to sustainability
and energy efficiency, for example design biking paths and electric vehicle routes,
map solar energy potential, map areas with high runoff potential that need
land use change, and asses erosion risk for areas with planned development.
<p>
If you do not have a project that you could use as a starting point, bellow are some ideas
based on projects from previous semesters.


<ul>
<li><b> Coastal dynamics</b>
    <ul>
       <li> beach/dune evolution and coastal erosion from lidar time series
       <li> sea level rise impact on barrier islands
       <li> Large coastal dunes migration analysis and visualization, implications for management
       <li> <i>get data from here:</i>
            <a href="http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/index.html">Digital Coast</a>
            and critically explore <a href="http://sealevel.climatecentral.org/ssrf/north-carolina">Sea level rise impact</a> interactive web map
    </ul>
<li><b>Solar irradiation and energy potential</b>
    <ul>
       <li> locations and buildings with best potential for solar energy in your neighborhood
       <li> spatial and temporal patterns of solar irradiation as input for ecosystem management
       <li> compare solar energy estimates from various sources: nrel, geomodel.sk, your own high resolution computation
       <li> <i>get the data here </i> - <a href="http://lidar.cr.usgs.gov/">CLICK</a>
            for multiple return lidar data, check nconemap.com for county data for building footprints
    </ul>
<li><b>Lidar data processing and Watershed analysis</b>
       <br>(data available for Shenandoah National Park, Mammoth Cave National Park, North Carolina
            and many other regions)
    <ul>
    <li>Mapping forest canopy height, understory vegetation and vegetation growth from lidar
    <li>Mapping landforms
     <li>Watershed analysis - stream mapping, stream buffer effectiveness, land use impacts
    </ul>
<li><b>Cost surfaces and least cost paths</b>
    <ul>
      <li> find suitable locations/routes for hiking trails, biking paths
      <li> find routes and solar charging station locations for alternative vehicles
    </ul>
<li><b>Hazards mapping and response management</b>
    <ul>
      <li> assess impact of natural distaster (hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, fires)
           <a href="http://hdds.usgs.gov/hdds2/">Hazards data distribution system</a>
           and provide analysis for responders and future disaster prevention/mitigation.
    </ul>
<li><b>Process modeling </b>
   <ul>
      <li>soil erosion modeling for different land use alternatives
      <li> Air pollution: linking plume simulation with GIS, polution distribution along roads
   </ul>
<li><b>Utilities planning and assessment </b>
   <ul>
      <li> identify optimal path for utilities infrastructure: pipes, cables, power lines
           that minimize cost and environmental impacts and fulfill a set of desired parameters
   </ul>
<li><b>Open source GIS development</b>
    <ul>
      <li>testing release candidate or a selected module under development
      <li>development or co-development a new add-on module,
      <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jlloyd/Lloydj_MEA582f11/Lloyd_ProjectPaper_mea582f11.pdf">
          Report on testing and enhancing v.transect add-on</a>
      <li>development of mobile application for smart phone or tablet, for example with GRASS
          under Debian or as Android App
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Things to consider:
<ul>
  <li>Well defined research question</li>
  <li>Availability of data</li>
  <li>Amount of work needed to process the data</li>
  <li>Availability of tools</li>
  <li>Intermediate results in case time runs out</li>
  <li>Answer to research question in form of map(s), 3D images</li>
  <li>Start selection of your topic next week,
    getting all your data ready may be time consuming</li>
  <li><em>Project must include a component that requires processing and/or analysis
    of continuous field(s), such as elevation, precipitation, chemical concentrations, continuous cost surfaces, etc.</em></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="Requirements">Project pre-proposal and final proposal</h3>
Pre-proposal sections: Define research question, select location, list available data, methods and tools
(any system or combination can be used - ArcGIS, GRASS, MATLAB, ERDAS, ...), describe expected results.
Pre-proposal serves to identify students who need assistance with the project topic.
<p>
Final project proposal can be based on the revised text of pre-proposal and includes the following sections:
Title, Introduction, Objective, Site (coordinates, coordinate system, units), Data sets,
Approach, Expected results, 5 references to relevant research papers; i
images showing your site location and sample data

<h3 id="Requirements">Project report and presentation requirements </h3>

Project is 40% of the final grade: 10% for presentation and 30% for project paper
