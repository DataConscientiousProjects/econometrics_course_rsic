<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Topics</h3>
You can use a topic from your thesis or expand a project that you have
worked on in other classes, but make sure that your <em>project
includes a component that requires processing and/or analysis of continuous field(s)</em>,
such as elevation, precipitation, chemical concentrations, etc.
<p>
You can collaborate on the projects, for example by studying different regions
and then compare the results. Or you can select
a common area (e.g. SW Wake county) and do several analyses related to sustainability
and energy efficiency, for example design biking paths and electric vehicle routes,
map solar energy potential, map areas with high runoff potential that need
land use change, and asses erosion risk for areas with planned development.
<p>

    of continuous field(s), such as elevation, precipitation, chemical concentrations, continuous cost surfaces, etc.</em></li>
</ul>


<h3>Project pre-proposal and final proposal</h3>

Pre-proposal sections: Define research question, select location, list available data, methods and tools
(any system or combination can be used - ArcGIS, GRASS, MATLAB, ERDAS, ...), describe expected results.
Pre-proposal serves to identify students who need assistance with the project topic.
<p>
Final project proposal can be based on the revised text of pre-proposal and includes the following sections:
Title, Introduction, Objective, Site (coordinates, coordinate system, units), Data sets,
Approach, Expected results, 5 references to relevant research papers;
images showing your site location and sample data


<h3 id="Requirements">Project report and presentation requirements</h3>

Project is 40% of the final grade: 10% for presentation and 30% for project paper

<h4>Paper</h4>

Structure and formatting should follow the scientific journal standards.
<!--<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=tgis20&page=instructions#.VI5qCs08ZN4">IJGIS</a>-->
<ul>
<li>Text: min. 4 pages, single spaced including tables and references</li>
<li>Figures: min 3 pages, images, maps, graphs, readable size, scale and legends where needed</li>
</ul>

Follow structure of a peer reviewed publication:

<ul>
<li>Intro/background: brief literature review, motivation for the research, research question / objective</li>
<li>Study site: where, why, geographic characteristics</li>
<li>Data: sources: agencies, web sites; coordinate systems and formats of the original data; coord. transformations and format conversions; vector/raster, resolutions, spatial extent</li>
<li>Methods/approach: describe methodology NOT software modules (see lectures), methods for analysis and modeling</li>
<li>Results and discussion: present and explain the results
qualitative and quantitative, tables, graphs, maps/images;
compare with results from other studies – confirms previously observed phenomena, shows something new,
which questions remain unresolved</li>
<li>Conclusion: summary of the most important findings including advances in methodology, future work</li>
<li>References: at least 5 papers from scientific journals, rest can be reports, web documents
<li>Appendix (optional): workflows, scripts, metadata. Software commands, issues go here</li>
</ul>

Further notes:
  <ul>
    <li>Use scientific language (no “visually pleasing results”, please)</li>
    <li>Spelling errors are unacceptable</li>
    <li>Images: make sure that all grid cells are rendered when it is important - both for 2D and in 3D, both in ArcGIS and GRASS GIS or convert to vector if you have line features that need to be preserved. Use well designed color tables and sufficient number of classes in ArcGIS to avoid losing information in maps.</li>
  </ul>
