<h2>Geospatial Modeling and Analysis</h2>

The course explains digital representation and analysis of geospatial
phenomena and provides foundations in methods and algorithms used in
GIS analysis. Special focus is on terrain modeling,
geomorphometry, watershed analysis and introductory  GIS-based
 modeling of landscape processes (water, sediment).
The course includes analysis from lidar data, 3D visualization,
and exploratory land management design with Tangible GIS.
Assignments are performed in Open source GRASS GIS and ArcGIS.
