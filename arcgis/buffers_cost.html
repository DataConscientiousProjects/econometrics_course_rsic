Include resulting maps into your report 
(use your judgement to decide which results to include).

<!-- <pre>
========================================================================
ALL COORDINATE SYSTEMS MUST BE DEFINED TO RUN BUFFER (i.e. .prj files)
========================================================================

<p>
Create the workspace for the current assignment as the folder Assign5<br>
<p>
To constrain analyses in a similar manner as g.region,
set the spatial extent using the options under Environments, for example:<br>
to constrain analyses results to the extents defined by intersection of input features:<br>

<pre>
Start ArcCatalog or ArcMap. 
Open the ArcToolbox. 
RC right on the ArcToolbox icon 
From the context menu -> Environments... -> Extent. 
Choose Intersection of Inputs. 
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
<!-- You can create a bounding polygon of the "elev" DEM by using the 3D Analyst Tools. Check out 3D Analyst (if you haven't already) > Open ArcToolbox > 3D Analyst Tools > Conversion > From Raster > Raster Domain
Input = "elev"
Output = "name your file"
Output Type = Line or Poly (I tend to use Poly so I can calculate area)
Then when you are clipping the extent of the Data Frame you can use the extent of your new file, instead of copy/pasting or writing down the extent of the raster.  -->

To work on a subset, clip your data to a given spatial extent.<br>
Constrain the drawing of project layers to a user specified extent.

<pre>
Start -> Programs -> ArcMap
Add ./ncrast.mdb/elev
Add ./ncshape.mdb/streets_wake
Dbl. Click the 'elev' layer in the TOC
Go to -> Layer Properties -> Extent
Write down the four numbers in the text fields labeled: 'Left', 'Right', 'Top', 'Bottom' 
Click 'OK'
Dbl. Click 'Layers' in the TOC
Go to ->'Data Frame Properties' -> 'Data Frame' -> 'Clip Options' -> 'Clip to Shape' 
Click 'Specify Shape'
Select 'Custom Extent' 
Uncheck the 'Degrees' check box
Enter the four numbers you recorded earlier in their appropriate text fields
Click 'OK'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<h3>Find developed areas close to lakes</h3>
Create the buffers:

<pre>
File -> Add Data -> Add Data...
Select ./ncrast.mdb/lakes
Select ./ncrast.mdb/landcl96
Check out a Spatial Analysis Extension license
Open the ArcToolbox (you may already have it open)
Select 'Spatial Analysis Tools->Distance->Euclidean Distance'
Set 'Input raster' to 'lakes'
Set Output distance raster' to '\Assign5\lk_dist' 
Set 'Maximum distance' to '500'
Leave the rest as defaults 
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Select the locations that overlay developed areas:

<pre>
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Map Algebra->Raster Calculator'
Type in the expression: SetNull( "landcl96" > 2, "lk_dist")
Set the Output raster to './Assign5/dev_lakes
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<h3>Compute cost surface from accident based on speed limits</h3>

<pre>
File -> Add Data -> Add Data...
Select ncshape.mdb/streets_wake
Open the ArcToolbox (if not already open)
Select 'Conversion Tools->To Raster->Polyline to Raster'
Set 'Input Features' to 'streets_wake'
Set 'Value field' to 'SPEED'
Set 'Output Raster Dataset to './Assign5/str_speed'
Set Cellsize to 30
Leave the others as defaults 
Click 'OK'

File -> Add Data -> Add Data...
select ./ncshape.mdb/fire_pt
</pre>

<p>
Set the working directory:

<pre>
Select Geoprocessing -> Environments...
Under 'Workspace' set the 'Current Workspace' to '.\Assign5'
Under 'Raster Analysis' set the 'Cell Size' to 'Same as layer str_speed'
Under 'Raster Analysis' set the  'Mask' to '.\ncshape.mdb\boundary_wake'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Assign travel time per cell in hours, compute cost surface.<br>
Assign null values a speed of 5.

<pre>
Open the ArcToolbox (if not already open)
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Map Algebra->Raster Calculator'
Type in the expression: Con(IsNull("str_speed"),5,"str_speed") 
Set the Output raster to 'str_speed2'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Calculate the traveltime and cost surface:

<pre>
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Map Algebra->Raster Calculator' 
Type in the expression: 0.018641 / "str_speed2"
Set the 'Output raster' to str_trv
Open the ArcToolbox (if not already open)
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Distance->Cost Distance'
Set 'Input raster or feature source data' to 'fire_pt'
Set 'Input Cost raster' to 'str_trv'    
Set 'Output distance raster' to './Assign5/str_cost'
Set 'Output backlink raster (optional)' to './Assign5/backlink'
Leave the rest as defaults
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<h3>Find cost from selected firestations</h3>

<pre>
File -> Add Data -> Add Data...
Select ./ncshape.mdb/firestations
Open the ArcToolbox (if not already open)
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Extraction->Sample'
Set 'Input rasters' to 'str_cost'
Set 'Input Location raster or point features' to 'firestations'
Set 'Output table' to './Assign5/station_costs'  
Leave everything else as defaults
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Add the table of costs (NOTE: in Arc 10 this should be added automatically at the bottom of the TOC).
However, if the table does not get added:
<pre>

File -> Add Data ->
Select '.\ssign5\station_costs'
</pre>

<p>
Open the station_costs table and sort on the field 'STR_COST':

<pre>
RMC 'station_costs' -> Open 
RMC column named 'STR_COST' and choose 'Sort Ascending'
Note the range of cost values.
Close the table
</pre>

<!--<p>
 #create the cost backlink (direction grid)
Open the ArcToolbox (if not already open)
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Distance->Cost Back Link'
Set 'Input raster or feature source data' to 'fire_pt'
Set the 'Input cost raster' to 'str_cost'
Set the 'Ouput Backlink raster' to '.\assign5\backlink'  
Click 'OK' -->


<p>
Find shortest path from nearby firestations.<br>
Note: create the firestations as a shapefile if the below
does not work with geodatabase firestations.

<pre>
Open the ArcToolbox (if not already open)
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Distance->Cost Path'
Set 'Input raster or feature destination data' to 'firestations'
Set 'Destination field' to 'FID'
Set the 'Input cost distance raster' to 'str_cost'
Set the 'Input cost backlink raster' to 'backlink'
Set the 'Output raster' to '.\Assign5\cost_path'
Set the 'Path type' to 'BEST_SINGLE'   
Click 'OK'
</pre>
<p>
Note: to see the resulting least cost (drive-time) path 
you may have to turn off some or most of the layers in your TOC.
