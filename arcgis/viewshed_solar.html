<h3>Viewshed Analysis</h3>

<pre>
Add the raster elev_ned
Add the point feature class fire_pt
</pre>

<p>
Use the Spatial Analysis Extension's Viewshed tool
to compute the the area visible from the fire_pt location.

<pre>
Open the ArcToolbox
ToolBox SA->Surface->Viewshed 
Set input surface to elev_ned
Set observer feature to fire_pt 
Give your viewshed a name, and store it in your ./Assign9 folder
Click OK to run the analysis
</pre>

<p>
What is the ground elevation at the fire_pt site?<br>
In the output (viewshed) raster the visible cells are given a value of 1,
while those not visible are assigned a value of 0.<br>
<span class="question">How many cells are visible in this view shed?<br>
How much area (in sq. meters) do these visible cells represent?</span><br>
Rerun the viewshed, with elevation offset at the fire_pnt site at +60 m.


<pre>
Add the field OFFSETA to the fire_pt attribute table. 
Enter 60 into the attribute field. 
</pre>

<p>
<span class="question">Now, how many cell are visible in this viewshed?<br>
How much additional area was gained by adding the 60 m of elevation
to the observer?</span>
<p>
Rerun the viewshed again, using the +60 m observer,
but this time limit your search radius to 2000m.

<pre>
Add the fields RADIUS1 and RADIUS2 to the fire_pt attribute table. 
Populate: RADIUS1=0 and RADIUS2=2000. 
</pre>

<p>
<span class="question">How many cells are visible in this viewshed?
How much ground area is visible?</span>
<p>
Restrict the search area to an annulus 1000 m wide
and restrict the search azimuth to the arc from NE (45 deg) to SE (135 deg).

<pre>
modify RADIUS1 and RADIUS2 fields accordingly
Add the fields AZIMUTH1 and AZIMUTH2 (as doubles) to the fire_pt attribute table 
and populate: AZIMUTH1=45, and AZIMUTH2=135.
</pre>

<p>
<span class="question">How many cells and area are visible now?</span>
<p>
To expand our repertoire a bit, let's next add our own data,
but instead of a single point, let's add a pair to the project<br>
(so that you know how to do this) and run one more
(just one, I promise) viewshed analysis.<br>
<p>
You can do this with any point data you wish, but if you don't have one handy,<br>
here's the coordinates (in NC State Plane NAD83) for Red Hat's Headquarters
over on Centennial Campus:

<pre>
x=638898 and y=224528
</pre>

<p>
And for Jordan Hall on Central Campus:

<pre>
x=638887, y=225365.
</pre>

<p>
Put these values into a text file (use e.g. Notepad but avoid MS Word).<br>
Your text file should look something like this:

<pre>
X,Y
638898,224528
638887,225365
</pre>

<p>
Load your points to ArcGIS:

<pre>
Add XY Data. (File->Add Data->Add XY Data...)
</pre>

<p>
Convert it from the resulting event to a feature class (or shape file).

<pre>
Add the fields OFFSETA, VERT1, VERT2, AZIMUTH1, and AZIMUTH2. 
Populate point FID=0: 
OFFSETA=35m, VERT1=12, VERT2=-12, AZIMUTH1=300, AZIMUTH2=60. 
For point FID=1: 
OFFSETA=40m, VERT1=12, VERT2=-12, AZIMUTH1=150, AZIMUTH2=240. 
Run a viewshed on your new data with these attributes.
</pre>

<p>
For an observer standing atop the Red Hat Building,
what do you think that this view shed result represents?<br>
Can the observer see Jordan Hall on the NCSU Central Campus?<br>
Do you think an observer standing atop Jordan Hall could see
his counterpart on the Red Hat Building?

<h3>Solar radiation analysis</h3>
Perform solar radiation analysis in Spatial Analyst:

<pre>
Display the Arc Toolbox. 
Select Geoprocessing->Environments. 
Under Workspace set the Current Workspace to point to the ncrast,mdb geodatabase
</pre>

<p>
Compute the solar incidence for the summer solstice (day number=180)

<pre>
Spatial Analysis Toolbox-Solar Radiation-Area Solar Radiation
use elev_ned for the input raster
Set the output raster = ned_solar180
Set the latitude = 35.7716 (~for Raleigh, NC)
Set the Time Configuration to Within a day
Set the Date/Time settings-Day number of year to 180
the remainder of the fields can be left at their default values.
</pre>

<p>
Repeat the above steps to generate a incident solar radiation raster
for the winter solstice (day number=356).<br>
Note: the computation can take some time.
<p>
<span class="question">What are the data units for the resulting incident radiation maps?</span><br>
<p>
Determine the difference in radiation energy between the two solstice extremes
by differencing the two radiation rasters just created.<br>

<pre>
Spatial Analyst > Map Algebra > Raster Calculator
Set output to solar_diff
In the calculator's expression field type:
"ned_solar180" - "ned_solar356"
</pre>

<p>
Change the color ramp to one that emphasizes contrast in the difference raster.<br>
<span class="question">Where do you see the greatest differences in insolation between summer and winter?<br>
Where does the least difference in annual insolation occur?<br>
Do these differences make sense? Please explain.</span>
