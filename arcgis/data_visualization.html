<h3>Viewing data in 2D</h3>

<h4>Raster data symbology</h4>
Display land use classes using custom color, add labels:

<pre>
File->Add Data->Add Data... ./ncrast.mdb/landcl96
RMC landcl96->Properties
LMC Symbology Tab
LMC on line 1 under Label - replace numbers 1-7 with these labels, respectively:
(hint: the tab key will move you to the next label entry)

developed
agriculture
herbaceous
shrubland
forest
water
sediment

LMC on color - replace the color for each land use by more intuitive one
(one that seems to fit the theme for the label - e.g. green for agriculture,
blue for water) by selecting from the provided pallette
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Save as layer to preserve the new color scheme and labels:

<pre>
LMC on the landcl96 entry in the Table of Contents (TOC) ->'Save as layer file...'
Navigate to .\Assign3
Save as landcl96.lyr
</pre>

<p>
Display only categories 1 and 2 from the land use map:

<pre>
RMC landcl96->Properties
LMC Symbology Tab
Use LMC to select items 3 - 7 (herbaceous - sediment)
LMC Remove button to remove values 3 through 7
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Display only elevation higher than 100 m over the geology map:

<pre>
File->Add Data->Add Datsa...  .\ncrast.mdb\geology
File->Add Data->Add Data...  .\ncrast.mdb\elev
RMC elev->Properties
LMC Symbology Tab
From the Show panel (far left) select 'Classified'
LMC Classify Button
Set the method to 'Equal Interval'
Set Classes to 10
LMC the 'Exclusion' button
Set the Excluded values to 1-100
Click 'OK'
Click 'OK'
LMC Display Tab -> Set the Transparency to 50%
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Change colors for raster maps:
<pre>
RMC elev->Properties
LMC Symbology Tab
Change the color ramp to one that goes from brown to blue
LMC the Symbol column heading (legend table) and select 'Flip Colors'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Use a histogram equalized color table to display topographic slope:
<p>
(Note: this crashes ArcMAP (r9.x) if original FP map is used on some computers if that
is the case, convert map to integers first. It appears that this same problem exists
in r10.x)

<pre>
File->Add Data->Add Data...  .\ncrast\slope
LMC Customize Menu->Extensions...
LMC in check box to select (check out) a Spatial Analyst Extensionlicense.
Click 'OK'
LMC ArcToolBox Window
LMC ArcToolBox->Spatial Analyst Tools->Math->Int
Input: slope
Output: .\Assign3\slopeint
RMC slopeint->Properties
LMC Symbology Tab
Choose the 'Red to Green Diverging, Bright' color ramp
Change the Stretch Type to Histogram Equalize
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<h4>Legend, scale, grid</h4>
<p>
Make a map with a legend, scale and grid:

<pre>
Turn off all layers except landcl96 in the TOC
File->Add Data->Add Data... ./ncshape.mdb/streams
Toggle to Layout View: View Menu->Layout View
</pre>

<p>
Assign a fixed scale for the layout:

<pre>
RMC Layers->Properties
Select Data Frame tab
In the Extent panel select Fixed Scale and set it to 1:50,000
Click 'OK'

</pre>

<p>
Add a legend<br>

<pre>
Insert Menu->Legend...
Accept the defaults for the first panel LMC 'Next >'
Replace the text "Legend" with "Land Classification" in the Legend title
LMC 'Next >'
Add a Legend Frame Border (select one as you feel appropriate)
LMC 'Next >'
LMC 'Next >'
LMC 'Finish'
Follow the menus until finished
Drag the legend to a more appropriate location, and resize as you feel is needed to
make it "fit" into your map.
</pre>

<p>
Add a scale bar:

<pre>
Insert Menu->Scale bar...
Select a scale bar (your choice)
LMC Properties to set Division Units to meters
Click 'OK'
Click 'OK'
Place and resize the legend as you see fit for your map design.
</pre>

<p>
Add a grid:

<pre>
RMC Layers->Properties
Select the Grids tab
Click 'New Grid...'
select 'Measured Grid'
Click 'Next >'
Leave all the settings as the defaults and click through the remaining windows
Click 'Finish'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Display roads with labels:

<pre>
File->Add Data->Add Data...  ./ncshape.mdb/roadsmajor
RMC (roadsmajor)->Properties
Select Labels tab
In the Text String Panel set the Label Field to 'ROAD_NAME'
Check the 'Label features in this layer' box (upper left corner of dialog window)
Click 'OK'
Note: you can optionally toggle label display by: RMC roadsmajor->Label Features
</pre>

<h4>Compare hillshades</h4>
<p>
For raster map elev, compare hillshade generated by the Symbology 'Switch on Hillshade':

<pre>
to the hillshade generated using the 3D Analyst Extension.
RMC elev->Properties...
Select the Symbology tab
Check the 'Use hillshade effect'
Set the Z to 3
Click 'OK'

LMC Customize Menu->Extensions...
Check out a 3D Analyst license
ArcToolBox->3D Analyst Tools->Raster Surface->Hillshade
Select elev as input, hillsh_el as output, zscale=3
Click 'OK'

RMC hillsh_el->Properties
Select the Display tab
Set the Transparency to 50%
</pre>

To examine the differences, zoom into an area of the data and toggle the hillsh_el layer
on and off (by repetitively checking and unchecking the layer in the TOC). This flash
technique is an extension of an older analog method used to rapidly flip between two
photographs. The rapid image interchange emphasizes differences.


<h3>Viewing data in 3D using ArcScene</h3>
Start ArcScene:

<pre>
Start -> Programs -> ArcGIS -> ArcScene
</pre>

<p>
Add data in ArcScene:

<pre>
LMC on the 'Add Data' Button in the tool bar
Add .\ncrast.mdb\elev
Note, you can shift-click (contiguous selections) or control-click
(non-contiguous selections) to add more than one data set at a time.
</pre>

<p>
Display 2-dimensional data as a 3-D surface (to render in 3-D):

<pre>
Dbl. click the 'elev' layer in the TOC
Select Layer Properties -> Base Heights
Select 'FLoating on a custom surface' and select .\ncrast.mdb\elev as the
elevation layer from the drop-down menu.
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
To change the vertical exaggeration (z-value multiplier, default is 1) for a layer:

<pre>
Dbl. Click 'Scene Layers' in the TOC
Go to ->'Scene Properties' -> 'General' tab -> 'Vertical Exaggeration'
Choose '10' from the drop-down list.
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Drape a vector feature over the 3-D (raster) surface:

<pre>
LMC on the 'Add Data' Button in the tool bar
Add  .\ncshape.mdb\streets_wake
Dbl. click on streets_wake in the TOC.
From Properties select Base Heights tab -> 'FLoating on a custom surface'
and select .\ncrast.mdb\elev as the elevation layer from the drop-down menu.
Set Elevations from features to 'No feature-based heights'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
this action will both drape the vector streets on the raster surface,
and clip the extent of the much larger streets data to that of the surface.

Change the color ramp for a layer:

<pre>
Dbl-Click on 'elev'
Go to the Symbology tab.
Use the 'Color Ramp' drop-down menu to scroll through the available ESRI-provided ramps.
Choose one of the color ramps
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Change the background color (useful for enhancing visualization).
Here we change illumination to simulate night.<br>

<pre>
Dbl-Click Scene Layers in the TOC
Go to -> Scene Properties -> General tab.
Choose the black color patch from the color palette drop-down menu
Click 'OK'.
</pre>

<p>
Adjust the direction (azimuth and altitude) and contrast of the light applied the surface:

<pre>
Reset the background color to white (refer to previous task)
Dbl-Click on 'elev'
Go to -> Rendering tab -> Effects
Check 'Shade areal features relative to the scene's light position'
Click 'OK'
Dbl-Click Scene Layers in the TOC
Go to -> Scene Properties -> Illumination tab
Reposition the light source by dragging the yellow "solar" indicators
to shift altitude and azimuth
Click 'OK'
</pre>
<p>
Note: the changes you make to solar altitude and azimuth are reflected immediately
in the view frame, so you migth want to drag the Scene Properties dialog to a position
such that you can see the rendered surface in ArcScene. From here, when you move the
Sun you'll see the changes made immediately applied to the rendered surface.


<p>
Adjust the lighting contrast:

<pre>
Dbl. Click Scene Layers in the TOC
Go to -> Scene Properties -> Illumination tab
Use the contrast slider to adjust contrast value
Click 'OK'
</pre>
<p>
Note: changes made using the contrast slider, like those controls associated with
solar altitude and azimuth, are reflected immediately in the data frame.
