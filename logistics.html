GRASS GIS is available to anybody and you can continue using it
on your computer after you graduate.

<h4>GRASS GIS</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        Free and open source package GRASS GIS 7.0
        (<a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/">official website</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>MS Windows 8+</b> (or Windows 7):
        <ul>
            <li>
                use the stand-alone installer package
                <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/binary/mswindows/native/">WinGRASS-7.0.1-1-Setup.exe</a>,
                alternatively, if you are more advanced user, you can explore

<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>

In the assignments you will be performing similar geospatial analyses
in two different software packages - GRASS GIS and ArcGIS.
<em>Both</em> GRASS GIS and ArcGIS solutions are required,
described in a single paper (more details see below).
Step-by-step instructions are provided, but it is your task to explain
what is being done in terms of methods and results,
based on the lectures, manual pages and other on-line resources.

<h4>Report</h4>
<ul>
  <li>For each topic (as indicated in the schedule) you will submit a brief paper
      with min. 800 word text and 2 or more pages of graphics</li>
  <li>Although the HW papers are short they should be written following the standards of scientific publications,
      either of the following two is acceptable:</li>
          <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/journals/geomorphology/0169-555X/guide-for-authors#25000"> Elsevier instructions </a>
          or
          <a href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/authors/authors_journals.html"> IEEE standards </a>.
          Please also read the first 10 pages on
          <a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea592/common/media/01/Understanding-the-Publishing-Process.pdf">Publishing process</a>
          which explain a structure of a scientific paper.
  <li> Required paper sections:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Introduction: task, problem, background</li>
      <li>Approach: general description of methods and concepts, do not repeat instructions
          and do not discuss software issues here - this section should be software independent, common for
          both Arc and GRASS and equations for methods should be included where appropriate.
          In this section you should demonstrate that for the given step-by-step instructions
          your were able to explain what methods are being used to solve the given problem</li>
          <li>Results: maps, graphs, tables with comments, focus on what is interesting in the data
              and the derived maps, how does the method used influence the results.
              Include answers to questions in this section. Post 4-6 images per page.</li>
          <li>Discussion: was there anything unexpected or problematic in the results?
                      Were there any issues related to the methdology? Also discuss the software issues,
                      including fixes and suggestions for improvements here.</li>
          <li>Conclusion: 1-2 sentences what you have learned</li>
          <li>References</li>
    </ol>
      <li>For additional suggestions, please read detailed <a href="report_guide.html">Report guide</a>.</li>
